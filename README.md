=====================

This file discribed the basic codes for 
---------------------------------
* Ordinary least squares (OLS): a type of linear least squares method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model.

* Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model, given observations. 

* Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods comprise a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution.
